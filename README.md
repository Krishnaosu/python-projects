#  Python Projects: Learning Data Analysis

Welcome! This repository contains a set of beginner-level Python projects I created as part of my journey to learn data analysis and improve my Python skills. Each notebook focuses on data exploration, cleaning, and basic insights using real-world datasets.

##  Projects Included

1. **P1_Weather.ipynb**  
   Performed basic cleaning and explored weather trends from a CSV dataset.

2. **P2_Cars.ipynb**  
   Cleaned and analyzed car data to practice data wrangling and understand patterns.

3. **P3_Police.ipynb**  
   Worked with a police dataset to clean missing values and generate simple summaries.

4. **P4_Covid.ipynb**  
   Explored regional COVID-19 data, identified null values, and used grouping functions.

5. **P5_London_Housing.ipynb**  
   Conducted basic data analysis on housing prices using sorting, filtering, and plotting.

##  Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Purpose

These projects helped me:
- Practice Python syntax and data structures
- Learn how to clean and explore datasets
- Use basic visualizations to support analysis

##  Next Steps

I plan to:
- Add documentation to each notebook
- Build beginner machine learning projects
- Learn version control and collaboration with GitHub
